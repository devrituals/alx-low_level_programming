'if' statement: The 'if' statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped.

'if...else' statement: The 'if...else' statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. It provides an alternative execution path.

'while loop': The 'while loop' is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It allows for iterative execution. The code inside the loop is executed repeatedly until the condition becomes false.
The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If the condition is false, the loop is exited, and the program continues with the code following the loop.


These control flow constructs provide flexibility in program execution based on certain conditions or iteration requirements. They are fundamental building blocks in programming and enable branching and looping behavior.
